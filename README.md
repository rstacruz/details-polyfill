> Polyfill for the HTML5 `<details>` element, no dependencies

![](docs/images/details-polyfill.gif)

<br>

Usage
-----

details-polyfill is available via npm.

```
npm install --save details-polyfill
```

Requiring it will immediately inject the needed behaviors.

```js
require('details-polyfill')
```

The file [index.js](index.js) is also usable as a standalone script.

How it works
------------

<details>
<summary>Just include the script on any page that uses <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.</summary>

In case the browser doesn't support `<details>`, it adds the following behaviors:

  - When clicking `details > summary`, it toggles the `open` attribute in `details`.

It also adds these CSS styles:

  - `summary:before` is styled with a disclosure triangle.
  - `details:not([open]) > :not(summary)` elements are hidden. (that is: all children of closed `details`, except `summary`)
  - The `<html>` element gets the `no-details` class.
 
</details>

Limitations
-----------

<details>
<summary>Keep these guidelines in mind.</summary>

#### No loose text

The `<details>` element must not have loose text inside it. Everything inside it should be in elements.

```html
<!-- ✗ This will NOT work -->
<details>
  <summary>More info...</summary>
  No info available.
</details>
```

```html
<!-- ✓ But this will -->
<details>
  <summary>More info...</summary>
  <span>No info available.</span>
</details>
```

#### Don't style summary::before
...unless it's for a disclosure triangle. This library uses `summary::before` to create a default triangle.

#### Summary as first child
The `summary` element must also be the first child of the `details` element. Browsers supporting the `details` element natively will hoist `summary` elements up, but details-polyfill.js won't.

#### JavaScript `el.open = true`
...will not work like how you think it does. You also need to do `.setAttribute('open', 'open')` or `.removeAttribute('open')`.

</details>


Alternatives
------------

<details>
<summary>Here are a few other polyfills for <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.</summary>

I wrote this because everything else out there either depend on big libraries, or are too complicated. In contrast, `details-polyfill` has <100 lines of code, and only comes with a *.js* file.
